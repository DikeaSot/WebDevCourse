        <h2>Let me introduce myself</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is Dikea Sotiropoulou and I was born the summer of 1998 in Cyprus <img class="gif" src="images/cyprus.gif" width="20" height="13" alt="Flag of Cyprus">.
            <br>I live in Athens <img class="gif" src="images/greece.gif" width="20" height="15" alt="Flag of Greece"> and I study <i>Computer Science</i> in <abbr title="Athens University of Economics and Business"><a href="https://www.aueb.gr/" target="_blank"> AUEB</a></abbr>
            <br>This semester I was supposed to be doing my Erasmus in Vienna <img class="gif" src="images/austria.gif" width="20" height="15" alt="Flag of Austria">
            <br> but because of the CoronaVirus crisis I had to return back to Greece.
        </p>

        <p>This is me when I had to accept that the first time I wanted to make a big step for my studies was a big failure:
