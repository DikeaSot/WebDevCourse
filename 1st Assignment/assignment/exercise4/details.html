                <p> First of all, Stavros Niarchos consists of an enormous park, which is like a forest, the Greek National Library, the national opera, a museum which is dedicated to the founder of the centre, and a restaurant with a huge variety of dishes.
                    The park is so gigantic that every time I go there I get lost. There is a playground where children can play as their parents are sitting on the benches across it, or on sunny days as they are having a picnic on the ground. Moreover,
                    not far from there, people of all ages can do yoga with a tutor and relax their muscles and free their mind. Some metres away, there is a lake with numerous of ducks and swans . Visitors have also the opportunity to do water bicycle
                    and exercise. Furthermore, they are given the choices of cycling and jogging. The park is so huge that there is no spatial problem or the fear of a collision.

                <p> As far as it concerns the library, the last two years it is hosted in Stavros Niarchos. Not all books have been moved yet from the old building, but whenever I needed a specific information about a project for the university, I was never
                    let down. Whether the visitor does not find the book he is looking for, there are plenty computers where he can search online for his answer. There are also huge touch screens all around the library where everyone can search and read
                    the newspapers of that day. The exciting part about that is that he cannot only read Greek newspapers and magazines, but the ones from any country he wishes as well.
