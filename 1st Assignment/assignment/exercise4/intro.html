                    I was checking the files in my computer the other day, and I saw that essay I had written when I was preparing myself for the CPE exams. The topic was about my favourite building and I had to elaborate the reasons I enjoy being there. It is not one of
                    my best essays I have ever written, but I liked the topic a lot and I wanted to share it with you. Enjoy :)

                    Many people believe that having a favourite place is really beneficial for yourself. Whenever you are exhausted, stressed or upset you can go there and forget everything for a little while. For me, a place like this is a building in Athens called "Stavros
                    Niarchos". It is a cultural centre where many people of my age go to study and some others, a little bit older, prefer it for relaxation.
